# tripify

A web application for travel enthusiasts who want to track finances for their trip and keep updated with the weather.

## Why Build Tripify?

I built tripify because I had previously used excel sheets to organize financial information for my vacations, but the user interface for excel was clunky. Tripify simplified the experience for me and allowed me to keep up to date with the weather!
